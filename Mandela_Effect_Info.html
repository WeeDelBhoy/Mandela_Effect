        <p>The Mandela Effect refers to a phenomenon where a large number of people remember an event or <br>detail differently than how it actually occurred. It is named after Nelson Mandela, as many people mistakenly recall him dying while in prison in the 1980s, when he actually passed away in 2013. The Mandela Effect has sparked numerous theories and discussions about collective false memories and the nature of reality.</p>
